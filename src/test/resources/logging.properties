# This is the default java.util.logging.config.file the Maven Surefire plugin will use (see pom.xml for configuration)
# when running unit tests

# This file is provided alongside "src/test/resources/log4j2.xml" because log4j isn't able to affect any logging
# that occurs through java.util.logging. Commonly used dependencies can use that package to log their information
# and without this configuration file, it can be frustrating to find a way to change what is being logged by
# those dependencies.

handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = INFO

# Additional configuration of classes using java.util.logging can be done here
#
# For example:
# com.sun.jersey.server.impl.application.WebApplicationImpl.level = WARNING
